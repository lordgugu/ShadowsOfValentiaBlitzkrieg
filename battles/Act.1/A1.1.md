# Act 1 - Battle of Zofia Harbor (DLC)

The smallest number of turns this can be completed in is five:
- Clive can Talk to Slayde on Turn 2 Player Phase at the earliest.
- Even when Slayde moves full speed to Escape, he can only do so on Turn 5 Ally Phase at the earliest.
- The goal is thus to reach Slayde as quickly as possible and rout all enemies by the time he escapes.
- All Blue Units must survive to collect the rewards from this DLC Map.

The general idea is to split the party in two:
- Reinforcements Team: Fernand, Cavalier w/o items
  - This team was chosen because they can pressure the western Red Units on Turn 1
  - This team can also block two reinforcements on Turn 2, including a Mage
- Boss Team: Clive, Javelin Cavalier, Bread Soldier
  - Clive needs to get to Slayde ASAP. He can make it in exactly 2 turns, so long as one of the Green Soldiers doesn't occupy the square left to Slayde. If this happens, it's a reset
  - The Javelin will be necessary to deal damage on at least one Mage during Enemy Phase
  - The Soldier can self-sustain if necessary, but also has better accuracy w/o a weapon

I based my strategy on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adMC-eByA5M
- This video succeeds the 5-turn clear, but loses a Blue Cavalier in the process
- Because I wanted the rewards for this DLC map, I figured out a way to spare the Cavalier
  - I played Turn 1 as in the video
  - During Enemy Phase, it's important that the Iron Lance Cavalier hit the Leftover Bread Brigand twice
  - In the video, on Turn 2, the Iron Lance Cavalier moves to KO the Mercenary while Fernand blocks the Mage reinforcement
  - Instead, I had the Iron Lance Cavalier block the Mage reinforcement and Fernand block a Brigand reinforcement two squares to the right and one down from the Cavalier
  - The rest of Player Phase is played as in the video
  - During Enemy Phase, the Leftover Bread Brigand suicides on Fernand because the Iron Lance Cavalier is out of range; this gives Fernand the Leftover Bread
  - The Mercenary attacks Fernand instead of the Cavalier to avoid getting killed, while the Brigand reinforcement gets doubled by the Cavalier and left at 12 HP, exactly enough so that the Cavalier can ORKO him without the Iron Lance during the next Enemy Phase
  - On Turn 3, I have the Iron Lance Cavalier move next to Fernand, but out of range of the Mercenary reinforcement, trade items, and Eat
  - Fernand meanwhile moves in to attack the Archer reinforcement
  - On Enemy Phase, both the Brigand and the damaged Mercenary will suicide on the Cavalier
  - The rest of the battle pretty much plays out the same as in the video, except that I still have a Cavalier with a Bread Piece left in the west
  - That means that both the Cavalier and Fernand can reliably survive all the enemies they face
- The east part of the map is still unreliable, though
  - Requires that no Green Soldier occupy the Tile left of Slayde on Turn 2
  - The Tile squares providing 20 avoid makes the already lackluster Javelin hit rates very shaky
  - Requires that Clive double the boss and the Brigand with him so that they can be taken out with the Javelin on Enemy Phase
  - A 6-turn clear is probably more reliable because you can draw the enemies out of the Tile + Supplies area and unto the bottom bridge, where hit rates are better. Turn 5 Player Phase can instead be used to Eat the Soldier's Bread

**Turn Count:** 5
