# Act 2 - Skirmish (Novis Cemetery)

Since I'll be focusing Mae as a power unit, she'll faced most of the Revenants. My other priorities were to also get some kills on Genny and Celica as they want to learn Physic and Seraphim ASAP.

Because I wanted to maximize her growths with the Taurus Shard, I couldn't afford to let Mae bring Provisions to heal up. This forced me to move more carefully with Genny, trying to get KO opportunities with Nosferatu while staying close enough to Mae to be able to patch her up.

In the end, I managed to clear the battle in four turns, on Enemy Phase. Mae got 5 KOs and leveled up, Genny got 2 KOs and is on the cusp of leveling up, which is great since I can probably rig some good bonuses within the first two turns of the next battle. Celica also got 2 KOs, but she's still a ways from her next level. She got some SP towards Plenitude with the Golden Dagger. I only need 11 more Revenant KOs to complete Peace for the Departed, but I'll probably wait to complete this on Act 3, when my Pegasus Knights and my Archers will allow me to clear the Skirmish in one turn.

After the battle, I went to Novis Greatport, recruited Saber, collected all the treasure and started the Secret Menu quest.

**Turn Count:** 4
