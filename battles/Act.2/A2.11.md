# Act 2 - Grinding

I allowed myself a limited amount of grinding in Act 2, mostly to reach a few utility benchmarks:

- Celica: Shove and Thunder
- Mae: Priestess
- Boey: Swap, Shove, and Thunder
- Genny: Physic
- Saber: Myrmidon
- Leon: Curved Shot
- Kamui: Myrmidon

This was done by completing a total of eight 1-turn battles in the Thieves' Shrine, much like in Act 1. The first one allowed Mae to hit LV11, after which I took a side trip to Seabound Shrine to have her drink from the Experience Fountain twice, then eat the Golden Apple. This allowed her to hit LV14 and promote to Priestess. While I was at the Seabound Shrine, I had Mae drink her fill from the HP Fountain and Leon from the Resistance Fountain. Leon also got +1 Attack from the Deliverance Hideout Fountain, as I will need him to be at 13 Attack or more by the time we're done with the Mountain Village in Act 3.

I tried to find some Wine at Deliverance Hideout, but my rewards weren't very fortuitous. That being said, I found plenty of stuff at Thieves' Shrine, in addition to plenty of Silver coins. While grinding, I also managed to get the following:

- Genny: Swap
- Saber: Plenitude
- Valbar: Mistdancer
- Leon/Kamui: C Support

**Turn Count:** 8 in Thieves' Shrine
