# Act 2 - First Pirate Raid

Another battle where Mae frontlines. She needs to hit a 9 Speed benchmark pretty soon, but seeing as she can face enough enemies on Turn 2 to get to LV3, I rigged it so that she could get +1 Speed now. My plan is to leave her on the cusp of LV4 by the start of the next battle, so that the next level can also yield more Speed.

Not an overly complex battle altogether, but I managed to sneak in a little more SP towards Plenitude for Celica and Saber. It was mostly a matter of rushing in with Mae headfirst, and taking out almost all opponents, including the boss. Celica and Genny also got one KO apiece.

**Turn Count:** 3
