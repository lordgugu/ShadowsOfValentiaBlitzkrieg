# Act 1 - Outpost Rescue (DLC)

The smallest number of turns this can be completed in is ten:
- This assumes that all Blue Units move as far as possible on every turn.
- The Iron Lance should be traded to Forsyth. He does most of the heavy lifting as he has th highest Attack and doubles every enemy except the Mercenary.
- Forsyth aims to rescue the two Green Soldiers top center, then move back to Escape.
- Lukas and Python make their way around to free the third Green Soldier, then move back to Escape.
- Lukas should body block for Python when he can, and heal using the Bread he traded from Forsyth.
- Python can outrange the enemy Archer when he wields the Iron Bow, but can otherwise double opponents without the weapon. I had Lukas take the Iron Bow from him when he had the chance to double opponents for a faster kill.
- Forsyth must Talk to the furthest Green Soldier on Turn 5, then the one below on Turn 6. This allows him to Escape on Turn 10.
- Python and Lukas must Talk to the third Green Soldier and open the Door, both on Turn 6. This allows them to Escape on Turn 10.
- I completely ignored the left-most enemy Archer and all the enemy reinforcements.

**Turn Count:** 10
