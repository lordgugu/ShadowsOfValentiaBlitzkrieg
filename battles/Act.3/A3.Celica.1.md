# Act 3 - Celica - Zofian Coast Battle

This is a tricky battle to clear in three turns, mostly because it relies on a number of lucky critical hits from Saber (who learns Sunder early on) and Leon. Both have rates near 40%, but they're still necessary. Furthermore, it relies on some cooperation from Palla and Catria during Ally Phase. I finished on Turn 3 Ally Phase as Palla finished off the last remaining Brigand who was making for the Supplies.

So basically, I sent Saber and Kamui to deal with the northern group, while Leon took care of the enemy Archer, one of the enemy Brigands in the western group, and the one crossing the Bridge from the Supplies. On the left side, I equipped Valbar with the Iron Shield to get him to learn Shove and sent him on the front lines while Celica, Boey, Genny, and Mae rained magic from across the River. I gave the Garth KO to Celica because I would like for her to learn Recover ASAP as this is a source of experience points that the rest of the Pilgrimage Army won't compete for.

Though I didn't get Valbar to learn Shove (he's one SP short), Saber did learn Sunder (which allowed him to OHKO the Mercenary), and Mae got her B Support with Boey. Celica got a few SP on the Golden Dagger, Kamui on the Iron Sword, and Leon on the Killer Bow +3.

After the battle, I visited Zofia Harbor to recruit Palla and Catria and begin three quests. I also decided to scope out the map reinforcements, to see how I can incorporate them in mandatory battles for extra Silver Marks and experience. There's some variety to the groups encountered, and I'll have to pick whichever group I can tackle without wasting additional time.
