# Prologue - Cemetery Battle

I could not find a way to clear this in one turn. One of the enemy cavaliers always remained non-aggressive. So instead I focused on trying to take out Slayde on turn 1 as the accuracy against him is not reliable.

- Moved Mycen to one of the graves and attacked Slayde
- Mycen took out Slayde during enemy phase, as well as all opponents except one, who did not attack Mycen
- Mycen took out the last opponent on player phase of turn 2
- Had to reset multiple times until Mycen managed to take out Slayde on turn 1

**Turn Count:** 2
