# Act 1 - Fleecer's Forest Battle

The three-turn clear isn't too difficult thanks to Alm weakening some Brigands along the way and forcing them into Heal AI. Although Battle Preparations are not allowed, I switched the deployment order as follows, to get better starting positions:

- Alm
- Gray
- Faye
- Lukas
- Tobin
- Kliff

I also equipped the following:

- Alm - **Lukas's Shield**: after one exchange, Alm learns Swap. However, because he needs to double the boss, he sends the shield to Convoy immediately after the ability is learned.
- Lukas - **Fernand's Lance**: he doesn't see much action this combat either, but he gets closer to Longearche.

The objectives this battle were:

- Getting Faye to LV2
- Getting Kliff to LV2

Incidentally, I also got Gray to LV6 and Alm to LV2.

**Turn Count:** 3
