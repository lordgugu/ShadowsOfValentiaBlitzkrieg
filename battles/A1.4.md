# Act 1 - Ram Woods Battle

The two-turn clear can be made possible by making sure that Alm, Gray, and Lukas double and chip all Brigands to allow most of them to suicide on Tobin. Although Battle Preparations are not allowed, I switched the deployment order as follows, to get better starting positions:

- Alm
- Lukas
- Faye
- Kliff
- Gray
- Tobin

I also equipped the following:

- Alm - **Lukas's Shield**: this lets him start learning Swap without losing the ability to double opponents on this map.
- Lukas - **Fernand's Lance**: although I would've preferred to equip him with the shield for the Swap utility, it's too heavy and prevents him from doubling. So instead he begins working on Longearche.

There are two problems to making the two-turn clear reliable:

- Occasional crits, especially by Alm, steal kills from Tobin, Faye, or Kliff
- Tobin sometimes needs to double a Brigand standing on a Forest square

Otherwise, the goal is to give 4 KOs to Tobin (for a level), and 1 KO apiece for Faye and Kliff.

**Turn Count:** 2
