# Act 1 - Thieves's Shrine

During the first visits to the Thieves' Shrine, we only battle the boss at the Mila Idol and avoid all random encounters. A first visit is made to collect the Iron Sword. Alm needs to equip it so that between Turn 1 Enemy Phase and Turn 2 Player Phase, he can bring the boss down to 2 HP for Kliff to KO him. The Exploration Order is:

- Alm
- Kliff
- Faye
- Lukas
- Tobin
- Gray

I also equipped the following:

- Alm - **Iron Sword**: needed to setup a boss kill for Kliff. Alm gets a few rounds of combat towards Wrath Strike.
- Lukas - **Fernand's Lance**: he only sees one more round of combat towards Longearche.
- Tobin - **Lukas's Shield**: with 7 base Speed, he still doubles even with the shield. That being said, Tobin is at 99 EXP at this point, so all he needs to do is deal any kind of damage to level up. He'll see two rounds of combat towards Swap.

The objectives this battle were:

- Getting Faye to LV3
- Getting Kliff to LV3
- Getting Tobin to LV4
- Getting Lukas to LV3

After the battle, I recruited Silque, and promoted my four Villagers:

| Character | Promotion | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gray      | Mage      | Much more useful in the early game due to the low Resistance of enemies and ability to ignore terrain                                                                    |
| Tobin     | Mage      | He's speed blessed, which is great combined with his early access to Excalibur                                                                                           |
| Faye      | Cleric    | Physic and Rescue utility                                                                                                                                                |
| Kliff     | Mercenary | The class bonuses patch up his terrible bases, doesn't care for a low base Attack because he'll be using the Lightning Sword soon, will eventually loop back into Archer |

After that, I don't use the fountains just yet (Tobin doesn't need them), but I cut down all the grass and collect as much Silver as I can on the way out. I return to Ram Village to complete The Sommelier, talk to the Greedy Old Man again, and return to the Thieves's Shrine to collect a few more Silver coins, the Mila Carving, and some Bread that was in one of the crates on the way to the Mila Carving.

**Turn Count:** 2
