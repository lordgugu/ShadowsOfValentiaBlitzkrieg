----------

This repository compiles my progress of the run. You can find detailed information as well as saves from the game. Tags will be created at the start of each Act.

- Hard/Classic
- Earn the Blitzkrieg Medal
  - It's generally possibly to complete the game in about 350 turns
  - This leaves some leeway for side-objectives and smart grinding
- Complete every quest
  - This can be tricky because _The Merchant of Death_ requires Celica to have 5 **Steel Lances** before completing her side of Act 4
  - Quests that can be completed before Act 6 will be completed during the Blitzkrieg turn count window
- Incorporate the Rise of the Deliverance DLC
  - This is mostly because I like this DLC for story reasons as it adds new support conversations
  - While I do not plan on significantly forging the rewards from the DLC, they will compensate the fact that I need to leave all Act 1 lances unclaimed by Alm, except for the **Ridersbane**
- Mila's Bounty DLC
  - I'm only allowed to use Pitchforks on **Lukas**, **Forsyth**, or **Valbar**, but only after they class-change to **Baron**
  - I'll probably class-change them to Archers after that
  - Because Celica doesn't have much access to Gold coins until Act 4, she'll be collecting Mila's Bounty 3. I'll incorporate trading around the Taurus Shard into my strategies
