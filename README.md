This document compiles my notes of the run. This repository also hosts the save files of the run that were extracted using Checkpoint. This run aims for a few goals:

- Hard Mode
- Earn the Blitzkrieg Medal
  - It's generally possibly to complete the game in about 350 turns
  - This leaves some leeway for side-objectives and smart grinding
- Complete every quest
  - This can be tricky because _The Merchant of Death_ requires Celica to have 5 **Steel Lances** before completing her side of Act 4
  - Quests that can be completed before Act 6 will be completed during the Blitzkrieg turn count window
- Incorporate the Rise of the Deliverance DLC
  - This is mostly because I like this DLC for story reasons as it adds new support conversations
  - While I do not plan on significantly forging the rewards from the DLC, they will compensate the fact that I need to leave all Act 1 lances unclaimed by Alm, except for the **Ridersbane**
- Use Free DLC
  - This is mostly for the three **Pitchforks**, but I'm only allowed to use them on **Lukas**, **Forsyth**, or **Valbar** after they class-change to **Baron**

## Prologue

### P-1 Cemetery Battle

I could not find a way to clear this in one turn. One of the enemy cavaliers always remained non-aggressive. So instead I focused on trying to take out Slayde on turn 1 as the accuracy against him is not reliable.

- Moved Mycen to one of the graves and attacked Slayde
- Mycen took out Slayde during enemy phase, as well as all opponents except one, who did not attack Mycen
- Mycen took out the last opponent on player phase of turn 2
- Had to reset multiple times until Mycen managed to take out Slayde on turn 1
